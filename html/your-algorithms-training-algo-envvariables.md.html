<p>As your algorithm runs in a container, it generates output including the status of the training job and model and output artifacts. Your algorithm should write this information to the following files, which are located in the container’s <code>/output</code> directory. Amazon SageMaker processes the information contained in this directory as follows: + <code>/opt/ml/output/failure</code>—If training fails, after all algorithm output (for example, logging) completes, your algorithm should write the failure description to this file. In a <code>DescribeTrainingJob</code> response, Amazon SageMaker returns the first 1024 characters from this file as <code>FailureReason</code>.</p>
<p>  + <code>/opt/ml/model</code>—Your algorithm should write all final model artifacts to this directory. Amazon SageMaker copies this data as a single object in compressed tar format to the S3 location that you specified in the <code>CreateTrainingJob</code> request. If multiple containers in a single training job write to this directory they should ensure no <code>file/directory</code> names clash. Amazon SageMaker aggregates the result in a tar file and uploads to s3.</p>
