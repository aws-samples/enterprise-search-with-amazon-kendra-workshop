<h1 class="title">Managing a Private Workforce<a name="sms-workforce-management-private"></a></h1>
</header>
<p>A <em>private workforce</em> is a group of workers that you choose. These can be employees of your company or a group of subject matter experts from your industry. For example, if the task is to label medical images, you could create a private workforce of people knowledgeable about the images in question.</p>
<p>You create <em>work teams</em> from your private workforce. If desired, you can assign each work team to a separate labeling job. A single worker can be in more than one work team.</p>
<p>Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth uses Amazon Cognito to define your private workforce and your work teams. Amazon Cognito is a service that you can use to create identities for your workers and authenticate these identities with identity providers. You can use providers such as the following: + Amazon Cognito identity provider + Social sign-in providers such as Facebook and Google + OpenID Connect (OIDC) providers + Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) providers such as Active Directory</p>
<p>After your workers are set up, you use Amazon Cognito to manage them. For more information about Amazon Cognito, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html">What Is Amazon Cognito?</a></p>
<p>Your workers are organized into two groups. The <em>workforce</em> is the entire set of workers that are available to work on your labeling jobs. The workforce corresponds to an Amazon Cognito user pool. A <em>work team</em> is a group of workers within your workforce that you can assign jobs to. The work team corresponds to an Amazon Cognito user group. A worker can be in more than one work team.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
You can only use one Amazon Cognito user pool as your Ground Truth labeling workforce. If you plan on using an existing Amazon Cognito user pool for your Ground Truth workforce, be sure to import the user pool and create a work team before you create your first labeling job.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html">Amazon Cognito User Pools</a>.</p>
<p>There are three ways that you can create a private workforce:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Import an existing Amazon Cognito user pool before you create your first labeling job.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Amazon SageMaker console to create a new Amazon Cognito user pool before you create your first labeling job.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new Amazon Cognito user pool while you are creating your first labeling job.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are using a pre-existing Amazon Cognito user pool for your private workforce, you must import the user pool into Ground Truth and create at least one work team, either by adding work team members in the Amazon SageMaker console or by importing an Amazon Cognito work group before you create your first labeling job for your private workforce.</p>
<p>After you create or import your private workforce you will see the <strong>Private workforce summary</strong> screen. On this screen you can see information about the Amazon Cognito user pool for your workforce, a list of work teams for your workforce, and a list of all of the members of your private workforce.</p>
<p>If you created your workforce using the Amazon SageMaker console, you can manage the members of your workforce in the Amazon SageMaker console or in the Amazon Cognito console. For example, you can use the Amazon SageMaker console to add, delete, and disable workers in the pool. If you imported the workforce from an existing Amazon Cognito user pool, you must use the Amazon Cognito console to manage the workforce.</p>
<p>If you have not created a private workforce when you create your labeling job, you are prompted to create one. Creating the workforce also creates a default work team containing all of the members of the workforce. If you have already created a private workforce, you instead enter the work team that should handle the labeling job.</p>
<p>You provide the following information to create the workforce and work team. + Up to 100 email addresses of the workforce members. Email addresses are case-sensitive. Your workers must log in using the same case as the address was initially entered. You can add additional workforce members after the job is created. + The name of your organization. This is used to customize the email sent to the workers. + A contact email address for workers to report issues related to the task.</p>
<p>When you create the labeling job an email is sent to each worker inviting them to join the workforce. Once the workforce is created, you can add, delete, and disable workers using the Amazon SageMaker console or the Amazon Cognito console.</p>
<p><strong>To create a private workforce using the console</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open the Amazon SageMaker console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <strong>Labeling workforces</strong> from the left menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>Private</strong> tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Create private team</strong> button. This process will create a private workforce and a work team.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose to <strong>Invite new workers by email</strong> or <strong>Import workers from existing Amazon Cognito user groups</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>To invite new workers by email</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Paste or type a list of email addresses, separated by commas, into the email addresses box. You may have up to 50 email addresses in this list.</li>
<li>Enter an organization name and contact email.</li>
<li>Optionally select an SNS topic to which to subscribe the team so workers are notified by email when new labeling jobs become available.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Create private team</strong> button.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>To Import workers from existing Amazon Cognito user groups</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a user pool you have created. User pools require a domain and an existing user group. If you get an error that the domain is missing, set it in the <strong>Domain name</strong> options within the <strong>App integration</strong> section of the Amazon Cognito control console for your group.</li>
<li>Select an app client. We recommend using a SageMaker generated client.</li>
<li>Select a user group from your pool to import its members.</li>
<li>Optionally select an SNS topic to which to subscribe the team so workers are notified by email when new labeling jobs become available.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Create private team</strong> button.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>After you have created the workforce, Ground Truth automatically creates a work team called <strong>Everyone-in-private-workforce</strong>. You can use this work team to assign a labeling job to your entire workforce.</p>
<p>Use a work team to assign members of your private workforce to a labeling job. When you create your workforce using the Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth console, there is a work team called <strong>Everyone-in-private-workforce</strong> that you can use if you want to assign your entire workforce to a labeling job. Because an imported Amazon Cognito user pool may contain members that you don’t want to include in your work teams, a similar work team is not created for Amazon Cognito user pools.</p>
<p>You have two choices to create a new work team. You can create a user group by using the Amazon Cognito console and then create a work team by importing the user group. You can import more than one user group into each work team. You manage the members of the work team by updating the user group in the Amazon Cognito console.</p>
<p>You can also create a work team in the Ground Truth console and add members from your workforce to the team.</p>
<p><strong>To create a work team using the Ground Truth console</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open the Amazon SageMaker console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose <strong>Labeling workforces</strong> from the left menu.</p></li>
<li><p>Under <strong>Private teams</strong>, choose <strong>Create private team</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Under <strong>Team details</strong>, give the team a name. The name must be unique in your account in an AWS Region.</p></li>
<li><p>Under <strong>Create a team using Amazon Cognito user groups</strong>, choose the method to use to create the group.</p></li>
<li><p>If you chose <strong>Create a team by adding workers to a new Amazon Cognito user group</strong>, select the workers to add to the team.</p>
<p>If you chose <strong>Create a team by importing existing Amazon Cognito user groups</strong>, choose the user groups that are part of the new team.</p></li>
<li><p>If you select an <strong>SNS topic</strong>, all workers added to the team are subscribed to the Amazon SNS topic and notified when new work items are available to the team. Select from a list of your existing Ground Truth related Amazon SNS topics or select <strong>Create new topic</strong> to open a topic-creation dialog.</p>
<p>Workers in a workteam subscribed to a topic receive notifications when a new job for that team becomes available and when one is about to expire.</p>
<p>Read <a href="sms-workforce-management-private-sns.md">Create and manage Amazon SNS topics for your work teams</a> for more information on creating and managing the Amazon SNS topic.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After you have created a work team, you can choose its name in the list of work teams to see more information about the team and change or set the Amazon SNS topic to which its members are subscribed. Any members of the team who were added to the team prior to the team being subscribed to a topic will need to be subscribed to that topic manually. Teams made from more than one imported user group must be edited in the Amazon Cognito console; otherwise you can add and remove workers using the team detail page.</p>
