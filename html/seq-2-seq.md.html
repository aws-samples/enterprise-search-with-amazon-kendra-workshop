<p>Amazon SageMaker Sequence to Sequence is a supervised learning algorithm where the input is a sequence of tokens (for example, text, audio) and the output generated is another sequence of tokens. Example applications include: machine translation (input a sentence from one language and predict what that sentence would be in another language), text summarization (input a longer string of words and predict a shorter string of words that is a summary), speech-to-text (audio clips converted into output sentences in tokens). Recently, problems in this domain have been successfully modeled with deep neural networks that show a significant performance boost over previous methodologies. Amazon SageMaker seq2seq uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models with attention as encoder-decoder architectures.</p>

<p><strong>Training</strong></p>
<p>Amazon SageMaker seq2seq expects data in RecordIO-Protobuf format. However, the tokens are expected as integers, not as floating points, as is usually the case.</p>
<p>A script to convert data from tokenized text files to the protobuf format is included in <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/seq2seq_translation_en-de/SageMaker-Seq2Seq-Translation-English-German.ipynb">the seq2seq example notebook</a>. In general, it packs the data into 32-bit integer tensors and generates the necessary vocabulary files, which are needed for metric calculation and inference.</p>
<p>After preprocessing is done, the algorithm can be invoked for training. The algorithm expects three channels: + <code>train</code>: It should contain the training data (for example, the <code>train.rec</code> file generated by the preprocessing script). + <code>validation</code>: It should contain the validation data (for example, the <code>val.rec</code> file generated by the preprocessing script). + <code>vocab</code>: It should contain two vocabulary files (<code>vocab.src.json</code> and <code>vocab.trg.json</code>)</p>
<p>If the algorithm doesn’t find data in any of these three channels, training results in an error.</p>
<p><strong>Inference</strong></p>
<p>For hosted endpoints, inference supports two data formats. To perform inference using space separated text tokens, use the <code>application/json</code> format. Otherwise, use the <code>recordio-protobuf</code> format to work with the integer encoded data. Both mode supports batching of input data. <code>application/json</code> format also allows you to visualize the attention matrix. + <code>application/json</code>: Expects the input in JSON format and returns the output in JSON format. Both content and accept types should be <code>application/json</code>. Each sequence is expected to be a string with whitespace separated tokens. This format is recommended when the number of source sequences in the batch is small. It also supports the following additional configuration options:</p>
<p><code>configuration</code>: {<code>attention_matrix</code>: <code>true</code>}: Returns the attention matrix for the particular input sequence. + <code>application/x-recordio-protobuf</code>: Expects the input in <code>recordio-protobuf</code> format and returns the output in <code>recordio-protobuf format</code>. Both content and accept types should be <code>applications/x-recordio-protobuf</code>. For this format, the source sequences must be converted into a list of integers for subsequent protobuf encoding. This format is recommended for bulk inference.</p>
<p>For batch transform, inference supports JSON Lines format. Batch transform expects the input in JSON Lines format and returns the output in JSON Lines format. Both content and accept types should be <code>application/jsonlines</code>. The format for input is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>content-type: application/jsonlines

{&quot;source&quot;: &quot;source_sequence_0&quot;}
{&quot;source&quot;: &quot;source_sequence_1&quot;}</code></pre>
<p>The format for response is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>accept: application/jsonlines

{&quot;target&quot;: &quot;predicted_sequence_0&quot;}
{&quot;target&quot;: &quot;predicted_sequence_1&quot;}</code></pre>
<p>For additional details on how to serialize and deserialize the inputs and outputs to specific formats for inference, see the <a href="#seq-2-seq-sample-notebooks">Sequence-to-Sequence Sample Notebooks</a> .</p>
<p>Currently Amazon SageMaker seq2seq is only supported on GPU instance types and is only set up to train on a single machine. But it does also offer support for multiple GPUs.</p>
