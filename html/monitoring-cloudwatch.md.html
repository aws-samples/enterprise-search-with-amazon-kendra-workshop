<h1 class="title">Monitor Amazon SageMaker with Amazon CloudWatch<a name="monitoring-cloudwatch"></a></h1>
</header>
<p>You can monitor Amazon SageMaker using Amazon CloudWatch, which collects raw data and processes it into readable, near real-time metrics. These statistics are kept for 15 months, so that you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing. However, the Amazon CloudWatch console limits the search to metrics that were updated in the last 2 weeks. This limitation ensures that the most current jobs are shown in your namespace. To graph metrics without using a search, specify its exact name in the source view. You can also set alarms that watch for certain thresholds, and send notifications or take actions when those thresholds are met. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/">Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon SageMaker model training jobs and endpoints write CloudWatch metrics and logs. The following tables list the metrics and dimensions for Amazon SageMaker.</p>
<p><strong>Endpoint Invocation Metrics</strong></p>
<p>The <code>AWS/SageMaker</code> namespace includes the following request metrics from calls to <a href="API_runtime_InvokeEndpoint.md">InvokeEndpoint</a> .</p>
<p>Metrics are available at a 1-minute frequency.</p>
<p>For information about how long CloudWatch metrics are retained for, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricStatistics.html">GetMetricStatistics</a> in the <em>Amazon CloudWatch API Reference</em>.</p>
