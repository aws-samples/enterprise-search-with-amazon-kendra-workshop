</header>
<p>To organize, find, and evaluate machine leaning model experiments, use Amazon SageMaker model tracking capabilities. Developing models typically requires extensive experimenting with different datasets, algorithms, and parameter values. Using the model tracking capability, you can search, filter and sort through hundreds and possibly thousands of experiments using model attributes such as parameters, metrics and tags. This helps you find the best model for your use case quickly.</p>
<p>Amazon SageMaker model tracking capability can be used to: + Find, organize, or evaluate training jobs using properties, hyperparameters, performance metrics, or any other metadata. + Find the best performing model by ranking the results of training jobs and models based on metrics, such as training loss or validation accuracy. + Trace the lineage of a model back to the training job and its related resources, such as the training datasets.</p>
<p>For a sample notebook that uses Amazon SageMaker model tracking capability to manage ML experiments, see <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/advanced_functionality/search/ml_experiment_management_using_search.ipynb">Managing ML Experimentation using Amazon SageMaker Model Tracking Capability</a>. For instructions on how to create and access Jupyter notebook instances that you can use to run the example in Amazon SageMaker, see <a href="nbi.md">Use Notebook Instances</a>. After you have created a notebook instance and opened it, choose the <strong>SageMaker Examples</strong> tab to see a list of all of the Amazon SageMaker samples. The notebook managing ML experiments is located in the <strong>Advanced Functionality</strong> section. To open a notebook, choose its <strong>Use</strong> tab and choose <strong>Create copy</strong>. If you have questions, post them on our <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=285">developer forum</a>.</p>

<p>To create and test a model, you need to conduct experiments. You can perform an experiment to test different algorithms, tune hyperparameters, or use different datasets. Typically, you study the effect of the changes made in these experiments on the performance of a model. You can organize these experiments by tagging them with key/ value pairs that are seaerchable.</p>
<p>To find a specific training job, model, or resource, use Amazon SageMaker model tracking to search on keywords in any items that are searchable. Searchable items include training jobs, models, hyperparameters, metadata, tags, and URLs. You can use model tracking with tags to help organize your training jobs. To refine your tracking results, you can search using multiple criteria.</p>
<p>To choose the optimal model for deployment, you need to evaluate how they performed against one or more metrics. You can use model tracking results to list, sort, and evaluate the performance of the models in your experiments.</p>

<p>To use Amazon SageMaker model tracking capability, create a search parameter, <code>search_params</code>, then use the search function found in the <code>smclient</code> of the AWS SDK for Python (Boto 3).</p>
<p>The following example shows how to use search using the API:</p>
<pre><code>import boto3

search_params={
   &quot;MaxResults&quot;: 10,
   &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;TrainingJob&quot;,
   &quot;SearchExpression&quot;: { 
      &quot;Filters&quot;: [{ 
            &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Tags.Project&quot;,
            &quot;Operator&quot;: &quot;Equals&quot;,
            &quot;Value&quot;: &quot;Project_Binary_Classifier&quot;
         }]},
  &quot;SortBy&quot;: &quot;Metrics.train:binary_classification_accuracy&quot;,
  &quot;SortOrder&quot;: &quot;Descending&quot;
}

smclient = boto3.client(service_name=&#39;sagemaker&#39;)
results = smclient.search(**search_params)</code></pre>
<p>To evaluate different models, see the metrics in a search result. To evaluate models using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto 3), create a table and plot it.</p>
<p>The following example shows how to use model tracking capability to evaluate models and to display the results in a table:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas

headers=[&quot;Training Job Name&quot;, &quot;Training Job Status&quot;, &quot;Batch Size&quot;, &quot;Binary Classification Accuracy&quot;]
rows=[]
for result in results[&#39;Results&#39;]: 
    trainingJob = result[&#39;TrainingJob&#39;]
    metrics = trainingJob[&#39;FinalMetricDataList&#39;]
    rows.append([trainingJob[&#39;TrainingJobName&#39;],
     trainingJob[&#39;TrainingJobStatus&#39;],
     trainingJob[&#39;HyperParameters&#39;][&#39;mini_batch_size&#39;],
     metrics[[x[&#39;MetricName&#39;] for x in  
     metrics].index(&#39;train:binary_classification_accuracy&#39;)][&#39;Value&#39;]
    ])

df = pandas.DataFrame(data=rows,columns=headers)

from IPython.display import display, HTMLdisplay(HTML(df.to_html()))</code></pre>
<p>To get suggestions for a search, use <a href="API_GetSearchSuggestions.md">GetSearchSuggestions</a> in the API.</p>
<p>The following code example for AWS SDK for Python (Boto 3) shows a <code>get_search_suggestions</code> request for items containing “linear”:</p>
<pre><code>search_suggestion_params={
   &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;TrainingJob&quot;,
   &quot;SuggestionQuery&quot;: { 
      &quot;PropertyNameQuery&quot;: { 
         &quot;PropertyNameHint&quot;: &quot;linear&quot;
      }
   }
}</code></pre>
<p>The following code shows an example of an expected response for <code>get_search_suggestions</code>:</p>
<pre><code>{
        &#39;PropertyNameSuggestions&#39;: [{&#39;PropertyName&#39;: &#39;hyperparameters.linear_init_method&#39;},
                    {&#39;PropertyName&#39;: &#39;hyperparameters.linear_init_value&#39;},
                    {&#39;PropertyName&#39;: &#39;hyperparameters.linear_init_sigma&#39;},
                    {&#39;PropertyName&#39;: &#39;hyperparameters.linear_lr&#39;},
                    {&#39;PropertyName&#39;: &#39;hyperparameters.linear_wd&#39;}]
}</code></pre>
<p>After you get the search suggestions, you can use one of the property names in a search.</p>
<p>You can use Amazon SageMaker model tracking capability to verify which datasets were used in training, where the holdout datasets were used, and other details about training jobs. Use it, for example, if you need to verify that a dataset was used in a training job for an audit or to verify compliance.</p>
<p>To check if a holdout dataset or any other dataset was used in a training job, search for its Amazon S3 URL. Amazon SageMaker model tracking uses the dataset as a search parameter and lists the training jobs that used the dataset. If your search result is empty, it means that the dataset was not used in a training job.</p>
<p>You can use Amazon SageMaker model tracking to trace information about the lineage of training jobs and model resources related to it, including the dataset, algorithm, hyperparameters, and metrics used. For example, if you find that the performance of a hosted model has declined, you can review its training job and the resources it used to determine what is causing the problem. This investigation can be done from the console or by using the API.</p>
<p>In the left navigation pane of the Amazon SageMaker, choose <strong>Endpoints</strong>, and select the relevant endpoint from the list of your deployed endpoints. Scroll to <strong>Endpoint Configuration Settings</strong>, which lists all the model versions deployed at the endpoint. Here you have access to a hyperlink to the Model Training Job that created that model in the first place. For an example that used a linear-learner model, you would see:</p>

</figure>
<p>To trace a model’s lineage, you need to obtain the model’s name, then use it to search for training jobs.</p>
<p>The following example shows how to use model tracking capability to trace a model’s lineage using the API:</p>
<pre><code># Get the name of model deployed at endpoint
endpoint_config = smclient.describe_endpoint_config(EndpointConfigName=endpointName)
model_name = endpoint_config[&#39;ProductionVariants&#39;][0][&#39;ModelName&#39;]

# Get the model&#39;s name
model = smclient.describe_model(ModelName=model_name)

# Search the training job by Amazon S3 location of model artifacts
search_params={
   &quot;MaxResults&quot;: 1,
   &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;TrainingJob&quot;,
   &quot;SearchExpression&quot;: { 
      &quot;Filters&quot;: [ 
         { 
            &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;ModelArtifacts.S3ModelArtifacts&quot;,
            &quot;Operator&quot;: &quot;Equals&quot;,
            &quot;Value&quot;: model[&#39;PrimaryContainer&#39;][&#39;ModelDataUrl&#39;]
         }]},
}
results = smclient.search(**search_params)</code></pre>
<p>After you find your training job, you can investigate the resources used to train the model.</p>
