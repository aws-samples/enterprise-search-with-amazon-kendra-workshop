</header>
<p>A training algorithm indicates whether it succeeded or failed using the exit code of its process.</p>
<p>A successful training execution should exit with an exit code of 0 and an unsuccessful training execution should exit with a non-zero exit code. These will be converted to “Completed” and “Failed” in the <code>TrainingJobStatus</code> returned by <code>DescribeTrainingJob</code>. This exit code convention is standard and is easily implemented in all languages. For example, in Python, you can use <code>sys.exit(1)</code> to signal a failure exit and simply running to the end of the main routine will cause Python to exit with code 0.</p>
<p>In the case of failure, the algorithm can write a description of the failure to the failure file. See next section for details.</p>
